# Portfolio

You're going to need a portfolio site to showcase the amazing projects you've built in WDI. Over this weekend, build your portfolio site or update your current portfolio site.  The technologies you use are up to you.

Make sure your site is hosted and live on the web.  If you need a back-end, you can host on Heroku.  If you have a static site, though, you can host with a service like github pages.  

## Requirements

  1. Create GitHub repo for your portfolio, and create a portfolio website.

  2. Include a list of your projects.  Each project description can include things like:
    - screenshot or project logo
    - elevator pitch / short description  
    - deployed site link  
    - github repo link    
    - your role on the project if you worked in a team  

  3. Choose one of the wireframes below to implement, or create your own wireframe.  (Click the inspiration link above each wireframe to see a live site following that pattern.)

  4. Make sure your site is responsive. It should look great on mobile devices and in different browsers.

  5. It makes sense to use a framework and/or template to get started, but make sure you use custom styles to differentiate your site from others using the same source.
